                      <p> Faizan has always proved himself to be a dependable employee and a hard worker with solid problem solving and technical skills. I was always impressed by Faizanâ€™s ability to complete the work assigned to him on time. Faizan not only met deadlines but also explains his programs in a way that non-experts can easily understand. This skill came in handy when he presented his programs to clients who weren't particularly tech savvy.</p>

                         <p>Faizan takes his work very seriously and regularly enrolled in classes to stay abreast of the newest developments in programming. His python and AI/ML skills have made him a valuable asset. He has also helped me to learn new technologies and frameworks, He is also of very friendly and helpful nature. </p>
